Apache Configuration
====================


The following examples show how to configure a vhost to make a PufferPanel instance on the same server accessible under ``panel.example.com``

To use Apache 2 as a reverse proxy you will need to enable the following modules:

* mod_proxy
* mod_proxy_http
* mod_proxy_wstunnel
* mod_rewrite


.. tab:: SSL

   This example assumes that you have a subdomain specific certificate located in Let's Encrypts default location, however you can of course use certificates from other authorities and certificates stored in other locations as well

   .. code::

      <IfModule mod_ssl.c>
          <VirtualHost _default_:443>
              ServerName panel.example.com

              ProxyPreserveHost On
              SSLProxyEngine On
              ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
              ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

              RewriteEngine on
              RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
              RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
              RewriteRule .* ws://localhost:8080%{REQUEST_URI} [P]

              SSLEngine on
              SSLCertificateFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/panel.example.com/fullchain.pem
              SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/letsencrypt/live/panel.example.com/privkey.pem
          </VirtualHost>
      </IfModule>

.. tab:: No SSL

   .. warning::

      | PufferPanel has to send sensitive data like passwords over the network
      | Because of this it is not advisable to run a publicly accessible instance on HTTP

   .. code::

      <VirtualHost _default_:80>
          ServerName panel.example.com

          ProxyPreserveHost On
          ProxyPass / http://localhost:8080/
          ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:8080/

          RewriteEngine on
          RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
          RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
          RewriteRule .* ws://localhost:8080%{REQUEST_URI} [P]
      </VirtualHost>
