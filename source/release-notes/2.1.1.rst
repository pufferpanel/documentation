v2.1.1 Release Notes
====================

v2.1.1 is a small bugfix to resolve an issue with the file manager when editing JSON files, and adding support for SMTP email. Do note that a lot of emails are not built-in yet, but you should be able to now configure any email provider. This also adds arm64 as a pre-built binary.
